Machine learning for the power system transient stability analysis

![alt text](FlowChart.jpg "FlowChart")

Ensemble learning, using a voting classifier, for the electrical power system transient stability analysis. Model is built using the `scikit-learn` Python library. Dataset has been produced from the numerical simulations of the IEEE New England benchmark test case, using the MATLAB Simulink environment and statistically post-processed for extracting appropriate features. This repository serves as an accompanying code-base for a conference paper.
